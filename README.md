SimpleBoundaryValueDiffEq.jl is a library of basic boundary value problem solvers. Similar to [SimpleDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SimpleDiffEq.jl), this library aims to serve as teaching tutorials for simple BVP solvers implementation, benchmarks and testing correctness of other complicated implementations.
